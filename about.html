  <p>  Arriving at the gates of Saachi Villagio transports you into an entirely different universe, exclusively conceptualised by the greatest designer known to man – Mother Nature! While most resorts need to incorporate or transplant greenery, here it already exists in abundance.

A pristine 4-acre plot of land flanked by open fields on 3 sides (full of medicinal plants like the moringa flower) and the entrance of Changod village on the fourth, where the ecological balance has been skilfully maintained by ensuring minimal human presence and interference.

A true sculptor doesn’t carve shapes in the rock but uncovers what already exists beneath the surface. Similarly, our focus has been on retaining the genuine, tranquil atmosphere and inviting a select number of privileged visitors to experience life as it was meant to be, by our creator.  

Proximity to India’s major metro Ahmedabad and Gujarat’s capital Gandhinagar enables quick and easy approach by road to Changod, the location of your dream destination, for every reason in every season.</p>

<h1>Discover</h1>

  <p>A restricted number of 9 distinctive dwelling units (a choice of 4 thematic options, each having their own appeal and inherent benefits) with Wi-Fi, air conditioning, television, 24×7 heated water and modern plumbing facilities accessible from a central lane down the spine blend urban comfort with rustic rural life.

 <h1>Experience</h1>
    <p>Where dawn is marked by the cooing sounds of countless koels as your morning alarm and over a hundred peacocks prancing on the grounds; approaching dusk heralded by the rhythmic galloping of tall, majestic Jodhpuri race horses of the illustrious Marwar breed – Bajirao, Mastani and Samsher – as they return to their enclosure.

        Reclining on the porch, basking in the warmth of early morning rays, time pauses as you walk barefoot amidst over 170 luscious, fruit laden chickoo trees, inhaling crisp, clear, unpolluted air and soaking in the sunshine, accompanied by the melodious sounds of birds chirping.
        
        Sipping a mugful of pure, whole milk, freshly sourced from the Gir cow Gauri (a full-time Saachi Villagio resident along with her companion Shankar the bullock), surrounded by lush greenery extending in every direction, life transcends the mundane daily existence and again feels worth living.</p>
